# Inference Simulations (Psych204)

This repository contains in-class exercises for Psych 204, featuring simulations and data manipulation using R and the tidyverse.

The Quarto Markdown document ch6_tea_simulations.qmd accompanies the Inference lecture from Psych 204 and guides you through key tasks related to statistical inference simulations, providing hands-on experience with data simulation and analysis.

## Project Overview

### Project Title: Inference Simulations

**Description**:  
This project provides a series of simulations and exercises focusing on generating data, running t-tests, visualizing results, and exploring null hypothesis distributions. It's designed to help students understand inferential statistics using R and the tidyverse.

**Purpose**:  
To give students practical experience with R programming, data simulation, and statistical inference.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/e-garzaelorduy/psych204_inclass_exercises.git
    ```
2. Install the required R packages by running the following in your R console:
    ```r
    install.packages("tidyverse")
    install.packages("ggplot2")
    install.packages("ggthemes") # optional, for enhanced plotting
    ```

## Usage

This project is intended to be run in **Quarto** to render the document into HTML format. If you haven't installed Quarto yet, you can find the installation guide [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

## Simulations Overview

This project includes the following simulation exercises:

	•	**Generating Tea-Rating Data:** Create a tibble of tea-ratings from different conditions (milk first vs. tea first), adjusting parameters such as sample size and variance.
	•	**T-Tests:** Perform t-tests to compare tea-rating conditions and assess significance.
	•	**Simulating Null Hypotheses:** Visualize the null hypothesis distribution using permutations of condition labels.
	•	**Confidence Intervals:** Calculate and plot confidence intervals and standard errors for each condition.
